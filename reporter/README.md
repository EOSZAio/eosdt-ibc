# IBC Reporter

Nodejs app running on a server that scans all blockchans for events and handles IBC.

## Setup

- Can be deployed on servers like any other NodeJS app.
- It's stateless and does not require any database.
- Requries Node.js

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# for production
npm start

# for testnets
npm run start-dev
```

The reporter requires environment variables to be set.
See `.template.env` - this file can be copied to `.env` and configured with the correct accounts and permissions.

```bash
# account name on EOS; permission used for reporting; private key for permission
EOS_IBC=maltareports;active;5JzSdC...
# ⚠️ Use your own endpoint here
EOS_ENDPOINT=https://api.eossweden.org:443
# same for WAX
WAX_ENDPOINT=https://chain.wax.io:443
WAX_IBC=maltareports;active;5JzSdC...
```

#### Setup using Docker
Build the image with below command and make note of container-id
```$ docker build .```
Run the docker cotainer with your updated env file. Refer this template env file https://github.com/maltablock/eosdt-ibc/blob/master/reporter/.template.env

``` docker run  --rm -it -v ${PWD}/env-commands:/env-commands aravindgv/eosdt:1.0.5```

#### Different CPU payer

One can specify a different CPU payer for the actions run by the reporters.

```bash
# append cpu-account;cpu-key to the existing reporter;permission;key
EOS_IBC=maltareports;active;5JzSdC...;cpupayer;5k...
```

## Monitoring

There are some optional endpoints that can be used to check the health of the reporter, or a list of logs and performed transfer events.

A simple health check reporting the last checked block number on the chains can be seen on [/health](http://localhost:8080/health).

Logs can be seen on [/logs](http://localhost:8080/logs).
